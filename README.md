# Gothic Invasion of Rome

A narrated, historically grounded illustrated drama about the Gothic crossing of the
Danube (376 CE) and the road to Adrianople (378 CE). Delivered as video: composed
still images with controlled moves, spoken narration, captions, and dubs.

**Current state:** See **`sessions/AGENT.md`** for live agent handoff (50-shot batch,
viewer on Vercel, song arc planned). Image pipeline: **OpenAI `gpt-image-2`** via
`scripts/generate_image.py` (not Cursor `GenerateImage`).

## Layout

```
bible/          The creative operating system. 00 and 01 are locked.
templates/      Seven fillable formats. Fill them; don't invent new ones.
prompts/        The brief to hand Claude for each fill pass.
assets/         Character sheets, location plans, boards, and images.
  registry.yaml Single source of truth for what exists and what is approved.
research/       Source excerpts and material-culture notes.
scripts/        Image generation (`generate_image.py` → OpenAI gpt-image-2).
viewer/         Next.js frame review app (keep / discard / reroll) — deploy to Vercel.
docs/           Cloud agent setup and secrets.
sessions/       Agent coordination (`AGENT.md`) and session archives.
```

## Read in this order

0. `sessions/AGENT.md` — **agent coordination + current state**
1. `bible/00-scope-and-decisions.md` — what this is, what's locked, what's deferred
2. `bible/01-creative-principles.md` — the ten principles, non-negotiable
3. `bible/02-style-bible.md` — the three-register system
4. `prompts/claude-brief.md` — how to get the details filled in
5. `docs/CLOUD-SETUP.md` — **required** for cloud agents (`OPENAI_API_KEY`)

## The one-paragraph version

Nothing important is invented at generation time. By the time a frame is produced,
the model has been handed an approved cast, approved costumes, approved props, an
approved set, and approved geography, and its remaining job is composition, light,
expression and moment. Degrees of freedom are removed progressively — from "what
could Fritigern look like" down to "photograph this specific instant from here" —
which is how a real production keeps a world stable while leaving each frame free.

## The grammar

Three rendering registers carry the epistemics. Fully realised where the sources are
solid, ink-and-wash where we're reconstructing, charcoal dissolving to bare paper
where history genuinely fails. The viewer learns this in about two minutes and is
never told. It means the work can be honest about what it doesn't know without ever
stopping to say so.

## Rules that break things if forgotten

- **No text inside any image, ever.** Labels are overlay layers. The piece is dubbed
  and captioned; painted-in English is untranslatable.
- **Generate at ~3× final linear resolution.** Moves crop into the image.
- **Compose in separated depth planes** if the frame will parallax.
- **Nothing gets designed twice.** Approved assets are inherited, not reinterpreted.
- **State, not just identity.** Reference `YOUNG-WARRIOR-376-C`, never
  `YOUNG-WARRIOR`.

## Open decisions

1. Mood presets — define the nine variables per mood in `bible/07-moods.md`.
2. Whether the 90-second pilot needs all three registers or just R1 and R3.
3. Whether R3 (uncut paper) reads as "unknowable" or merely "unfinished".

## The test

> If the narration were removed, would this still feel like people living through
> something, rather than illustrations of something that happened?

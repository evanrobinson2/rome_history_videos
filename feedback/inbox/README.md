Where each file came from. A Mac path here is provenance only — cloud agents
cannot open it. Use the file in this folder.

**`audio1834333043.m4a` is valid.** 48:31 AAC-LC stereo, 67 kb/s, 23 MB.
Localhost playback is fine (user confirmed). Cloud agents cannot hear files
and must not call this recording broken. Transcribe with
`scripts/transcribe_inbox.py` (needs `OPENAI_API_KEY` with credits), then
read the `.md`. Do not `Read` the `.m4a` as text.
